## Overview

This sprint will introduce several important concepts related to probability and randomness. These concepts are the building blocks of more complex stochastic models and simulations that we'll talk about in later units.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this sprint, you will be familiar with the following concepts.

1. The probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete distribution.

2. Using the sample space of a random variable to reason about the probabilities of events.

3. Calculating the expected value, variance, and coefficient of variation of a discrete distribution.

4. Conditional probability and the concept of independent events.

5. Bayes' Rule and how to use it to calculate conditional probabilities.

## Deliverables

Complete the questions in `Deliverable_Questions.md`.

You can write up your answers in a document or write them by hand and then scan your pages.

## Topics

At the end of this sprint, you should be familiar with the following concepts and examples.

- The definition of sample spaces, outcomes, and events. Be able to write the sample space and events for simple experiments using set notation.

- Definition of the probability mass function and the concept of total probability.

- Know the definition of expected value and variance and be able to calculate them for a given random variable. Be able to prove the linearity of the expected value.

- Be able to use total probability to simplify random variable calculations.

- Definitions of joint probabilities, conditional probabilities, and independence.

- Be able to reason about conditional probabilities, using the formal definition and the reduced sample space / tree diagram approach. Look at the urn problems and other examples in the linked resources.

## Resources

There are two files in the `Notes` directory that you should start with. These are my write-ups on the important concepts for this sprint.

The first, `Probability_Notes.pdf` introduces the key terms of probability theory:

- Sample spaces, events, and random variables
- Probability mass functions
- Expected value and variance of discrete distributions
- Bernoulli trials

Read through it one section at a time. Take care to understand the reasoning behind the examples, then attempt the practice questions before moving on to the next section.

The second document, `Conditonal_Probability_and_Bayes_Rule.pdf` introduces those two topics. The important elements are

- The definition of conditional and joint probabilities
- Independence of events
- Reasoning about conditional events using the reduced sample space
- The definition of Bayes' Rule
- The blood test example: this is an important example and its the template for all of our applications of Bayes' Rule

After you read my notes, [look here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-conditional.html) for more examples. The link illustrates the use of tree diagrams, which is a useful method for reasoning about sequential events. The same site has a [useful page on Bayes' Theorem](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bayes-theorem.html).

For a more technical mathematical overview of probability, take a look at [these notes](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~seppalai/notes-for-courses/prob-basics.pdf) by Prof. Timo Seppäläinen of UW-Madison. You don't need these to learn the sprint material, but they provide some additional formal mathematical context and examples that may be helpful.

If you would like to see more examples and development of the ideas in the notes, take a look at Chapter 4 of [this](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) *Introduction to Probability* text by Grinstead and Snell.
